# 🎮 Phaser 3 Web Game

This repository contains a **web-based game built with Phaser 3**, integrated into a **Laravel application** responsible for handling the web layer and game-related APIs.

The project was developed as an **experimental and learning-oriented side project**, combining frontend game logic with a backend framework to explore different architectural approaches.
